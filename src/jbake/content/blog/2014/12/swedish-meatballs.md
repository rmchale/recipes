There are almost as many recipes for Swedish meatballs as there are
Swedish amateur chefs. The three main types are (1) small, fried, served
without sauce; (2) large, fried, served in brown gravy; (3) medium size,
boiled, served in sauce. The present recipe is a very simple version of
type-1 meatballs, a children’s favourite.

#### Ingredients ####

	500 grammes (1 lb) ground beef
	1 small onion
	1 egg
	1/4 cup dried bread crumbs
	vegetable oil (for frying)
	salt, pepper

#### Proceed as follows ####

1. Finely grate or chop the onion.

2. Mix the ground beef, the onion, the egg and the bread crumbs. Add some white pepper and salt to taste.

3. Form into 30 walnut-size meatballs.

4. Heat 2 tbsp of vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Sauté the meatballs in two batches until browned on all sides and cooked through (approximately ten minutes).
